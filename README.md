# Reinforcement Learning for Path Optimization  

## üìå Overview  
This project implements a **reinforcement learning agent** that learns to navigate a dynamic environment efficiently. The model, trained using **Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and policy optimization**, optimizes real-time decision-making, making it applicable to **autonomous navigation and robotics** in pacman.  

## üöÄ Features  
- **Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Policy Optimization** implementations  
- **Dynamic path planning** in a changing environment  
- **Real-time decision-making and obstacle avoidance**  
- **Scalable framework applicable to robotics and autonomous systems**  

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch** (for RL model training)  
- **OpenAI Gym** (for environment simulation)  
- **NumPy & Matplotlib** (for analysis & visualization)
